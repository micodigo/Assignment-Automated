# Assignment-Automated :octocat:
This is our first automation project based on Selenium-Webdriver with Python.

- Selenium is a strong set of tools that firmly supports the quick development of test automation of web applications. It offers a set of testing functions that are specially designed to the requirements of testing of a web application and for automation. It makes use of various scripting languages for its test automation.
- Python is a high level and object-based scripting language that is designed in a user-friendly manner. It makes use of simple English keywords that requires very easy interpretation. It has few syntax complications compared to other languages for programming.

## Selenium + Python
Python language is used with Selenium for testing. It has far less verbose and easy to use than any other programming language. The Python APIs empower you to connect with the browser through Selenium. Selenium can send the standard Python commands to different browsers, despite variation in their browser's design.

## Intro
This project will help students of IMSEC to download all the assignments from the college portal (Portal link:- http://52.220.116.248/) and segregate them based upon their respected subjects. Instead of doing it manually i.e. by clicking each assignment, this project will help them to save their time by just one click.

Once you open auto_assignments_download.exe it will ask for some credentials i.e. 
:heavy_check_mark: College Id
:heavy_check_mark: Password
:heavy_check_mark: Section
Once you enter all the credentials and hit enter. Now you don't need to do anything, this project will do the rest of the work. This will create an Assignment folder into the current directory and inside the assignment folder, it will create some folders which are subjected folders whose assignments are presented at the portal. It will download all the assignments into their respective subject folders. When all the assignments are downloaded it will automatically log-out from the portal.
